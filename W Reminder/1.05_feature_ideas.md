# v1.05 Feature Ideas for W-Reminder

## 1. 🤝 Social Leaderboard (Growth & Retention)
Leverage your existing gamification (`xp`, `level`, `streaks`) by letting users compete.
- **Concept:** minimal "Friends" list.
- **UI:** A simple list showing You vs Friends, sorted by Weekly XP or Current Streak.
- **Smart Integration:** "Your friend Bugatti just hit Level 5!" notifications.

## 2. 📍 Smart Location Reminders (Utility)
Expand the "Smart Input" to handle places.
- **Concept:** "Remind me to buy milk at Costco".
- **Tech:** Uses CoreLocation.
- **Smart Parser Update:** Detect "at [Location]" not just as time, but as a place search.

## 3. 🍅 Focus Timer / Pomodoro (Productivity)
- **Concept:** Select a task -> "Start Session".
- **Gamification:** 
    - 1 minute of focus = 10 XP.
    - Pausing/Leaving app breaks the combo.
- **UI:** Full-screen timer with a beautiful circular progress ring (matching your theme).

## 4. 📸 Task Attachments (Utility)
- **Concept:** Attach a photo to a task (e.g., a bill to pay, a photo of the item to buy).
- **Backend:** Supabase Storage bucket `attachments`.
- **Database:** New table `task_attachments` linking `checklist_id` to `storage_path`.

## 5. 🗣️ Voice Commands / Siri Shortcuts
- **Concept:** "Hey Siri, add a task to W-Reminder".
- **Tech:** App Intents framework.
- **Why:** Zero-friction entry.

### Recommended First Step: **Visual Stats Dashboard (Frontend Only)**
Since you have `completed_at` and `created_at` in your DB, you can build a **"Productivity Pulse"** page without touching the backend:
- **Weekly Completion Graph:** Bar chart of tasks done M-T-W-T-F-S-S.
- **Completion Rate:** % of tasks completed vs created.
- **Best Day:** "You are most productive on Tuesdays".
